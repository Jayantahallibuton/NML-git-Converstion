It all depends on whether that DTD referred to defines any entities
 and the document you want to parse has any entity references to such entities.
 If the XML does not have any entity references then you can safely ignore it by setting XmlResolver to null:

            XmlReaderSettings xrs = new XmlReaderSettings();
            xrs.XmlResolver = null;
            xrs.ProhibitDtd = false;
            using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(@"file.xml", xrs))

            { 

               // use reader here

            }
